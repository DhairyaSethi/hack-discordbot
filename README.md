# Hackathon Discord Bot
A discord bot to facilitate organizing your hackathon. Initial Release for [HACK4SHE '20](https://hackforshe.tech). Built on DiscordJS, Google Sheets db.
Extremely simple to manage with google sheets as a databse for efficient collaboration.

- Host meme contests and tally scores.
- Create individual roles and channels for each team.

## Commands
- `register` - gives HackPendingRole to participant and records their email and team name in the sheets db. Additional `unregister`, `update-team` for quality of life.
